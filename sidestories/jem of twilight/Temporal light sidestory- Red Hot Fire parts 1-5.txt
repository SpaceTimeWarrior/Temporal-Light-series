Name: Red Hot Fire part 1
Timeframe: Mid-April after Light of Pain
Starting location: luna
Fog is advising Jem and flare about Jem's Pregnancy

Fog: I think by now you should know your child is projected to arrive sometime next month with a high probability around the 10th-16th

Jem: Why can't you give me a more accurate date.

Fog: unlike most other sciences you are dealing with living beings that can be unpredictable. This is about as accurate as I can give without giving a false prediction

soon after a gunshot breaks through the glass roof barely misses jem's head by about 1/4 inch and knocks Fog's glasses off her head. Then the glass from the ceiling shattered.

Bright enters the room hearing the commotion.

Flare: Get Jem and Fog out of here maybe the Bunker NOW

Without saying a word Bright grabs Jem's hand and then fog and yanks them at high speed

Jem: What is going on

Bright: Don't know exactly but judging from the damage and where Flare told me to go, I assume someone tried to kill you.

Fog: aren't you the one that does pranks. is this one big prank.

bright: Unlikely or at the very least I am not in it. THIS IS SERIOUS.

Jem: ...who might do this?

bright: there are a few groups that might but only one pair of mercenaries comes to mind. ... squeegee and leech

fog: funny names.

bright: but not funny actions. They used to be my second in command. but I had to cut them loose they were getting too high profile. and even taking jobs behind my back. but something is off.

Jem: What do you mean

bright: normally squeegee shoots from above and leech attacks from below while distracted by squeegee's attack but there was only a arial attack

Meanwhile, a few minutes after

Flare: you can come out now. WHY DID YOU TRY TO KILL MY WIFE?

A Male black dragon whose limbs look like that of clouds comes out of the shadow. They are armed to the teeth with armor and weapons.

???: it's only business

flare: Where is Leech you two are normally a pair.

???: We had some disagreements.

flare: sounds to me like you finally found something even leech won't kill for money.

???: ...SHUT UP YOU FILTHY F$%^ING PIG YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT

Flare: oh did I strike a nerve your sister was the one who did all the work. WHO DO YOU WORK FOR ANYWAYS?

???: I am not telling.

Flare: If you are here to kill me show me your best shot

flare then slams the centerpiece on his outfit one sword materializes in each hand and then the cloth turns into a form of flexible armor. then preforms a taunting pose

flare: DIE YOU SCALEY SCUM.

??? Then runs up to punch flare in the face
??? flare jumps left and ??? punches the wall
flare then tries to slice ??? with his left sword and hits the tip of their tail causing it to bleed profusely but ??? dodged out of the way (to the left) just in time
??? starts to charge up a ball of air magic and tosses it at flare. flare leans back and the ball barely misses and hits a computer behind him, ripping it to shreds. ??? closes the gap between the two.
flare then slams his head forward hitting ??? in the stomach. ??? tries not to vomit from the injury
??? takes a few steps back and loses their balance
??? tries to stand up but flare just kicks him down
??? kicks flare causing him to take a step back. ??? gets back on his feet
??? uses a light spell and temporarily blinds flare when his vision returns ??? is gone 
Soon after a loud metallic bang rang out behind flare.
when flare turned around ??? was on the floor unconscious and prine holding a large metal object

Flare: thank you prine what is the occasion.
Prine: I cam' teh deliver your next package o' weapons and I herd teh glass breakin'. I got the right one?
Flare: yes, this A%$hole just tried to kill my wife. Bright is watching over her at the moment to make sure there is no surprises.
prine: the missus is safe, good now let's make sur' he trets wemon correctly.

Meanwhile

Jem, fog, and bright enter a bunker and go down 6 floors (every 3 steps has a armed guard) inside is a room with a few computer terminals.
Jem: Let’s contact mom, maybe she can help with that.
Bright: just to let you know this is not the bunker but a temporary checkpoint but yes that might help
fog: temporary checkpoint with that security what are you preparing for nuclear war?
Bright: worse a mafia war. Nuclear war still has rules in comparison.
Everyone went silent and was interrupted by a video call with pearlite.
Pearlite: how are things going...where is flar- Bright cuts pearlite off
Bright: someone tried to kill Jem and fog. flare is fighting off the assassin.
The pearlite’s fur seemed to get a few shades lighter
Pearlite: someone tried to kill my daughter. Since both cay and dark are out on a mission, I am sending my solar council spy in. Allium came here.
Allium: if you want me to do that would blow my cover.
bright: not if we rendezvous at the Venus police station.
Allium: ... that might work.

Meanwhile
??? wakes up in chains and is locked in place. and flare is next to the console in a poorly lit room
Flare: you will give me answers or else
???: what are you going to do to me isn't that illegal.
flare: you know that won't work with me it might with my wife but not me
flare then presses a button on the console and a electric shock goes across???
flare: you better give me the answers I want, or I might have to itch my trigger finger.

Flare: you will give me answers or else
???: what are you going to do to me isn't that illegal.
flare: you know that won't work with me it might with my wife but not me
flare then presses a button on the console and an electric shock goes across???
flare: you better give me the answers I want, or I might have to itch my trigger finger.

???: I will never talk I want a lawyer.
flare: do you really think attacking a former mafia boss' family and the mafia boss will act according to the law you should know as much as anyone. (flare presses the button midway through that line and shocks ???)
???: A#$%# Leech will come, and she will kill you.
flare: oh, will she now and why is that.
???: ... ...
flare: exactly first question what is your name
???: I am wait; why do I have to cooperate with you
flare presses the button and shocks???
???: fine I am squeegee deathdragon
flare: better why did you attempt to shoot my wife. 
squeegee thinks about lying then flare gestures toward the button almost taunting him to lie
squeegee: I was hired by a person with the online handle of death litch4560
flare: Why did leech not help you?
squeegee: Leech hates killing children
flare: I always wanted to ask if you are related by blood or by adoption
squeegee: biologically I am not related at all, she is just a friend I call my sister. This is all I know
flare: thanks for the help 
flare then walks out of the room
squeegee: anyone there to help... anyone
flare comes back in, and knocks squeegee out
flare then put squeegee in a black bag and put him in the cow manure storage pile.
flare: finally done taking out the trash I have to check in with bright
Flare then sees bright, Jem, and fog walking toward the landing bay with the Intrepid flyer in it
Flare: hey, just finished taking out the trash
flare ran over toward the group
bright: did your interrogation prove successful
flare: kind of all I got was the person who hired him goes by litch4560 online do any of you know that handle
bright: no clue
Jem: ...It could be my sister, but I don't know the numbers, but I do know litch is in their handle
bright: we are going to Venus to get more security from jem's mom.
flare: that couldn't hurt where is it
Jem: We plan to meet up at the main solar council police station
flare: smart most mafia members know attacking someone near there is suicide. sounds good.

After a 6 hour trip the group arrived on landing Bay Alpha 2
allium and two bunny guards following her one male and one female

Allium: glad you came. There was an attempt to plant explosives on the original landing site you were going to land on. The culprits are behind bars. We think that we got all the explosives out, but we did not want to risk it. Did you get any leads since the last time we talked.

flare: the attacker accidentally left a note stating that someone that goes by the handle litch4560 hired them.
allium (seemingly not believing the part that they accidentally left it): can we see the note
flare: it burnt up immediately after I read it
allium (really not believing that): ... fine can you give a description of the attacker
flare: even better I can give you a name that is in your database squeegee deathdragon. but I will give a description a 8' tale male black sky dragon with pen-...adult tattoos on his neck and emerald, green eyes. sadly, he got away.

Meanwhile
leech a female blue earth dragon got out of her starship after getting a distress signal from squeegee
leech: he has to be here somewhere.
instantly notices a pile of crap.
leech: I hope he isn't in that 
The handheld device started beeping louder and quicker the closer she got to the pile
leech: aww s$%^$. There is someone inside a bag deep in the pile
leech opens the bag to find squeegee but something is off
leech: looks like you had a hard night
squeegee (with a slightly higher pitch): what do you mean I'm fine
leech: it looks like you have been drinking again and not just normal soda (bottles are inside pile around him) but ones with succubus oil...that is what is off about you.
squeegee: Naw but let’s go home
squeegee does not notice the changes until they had to go use the bathroom and swears he will have his revenge on flare. it wore off the next day

A ship passes by and heading toward Venus

Meanwhile on Venus Jem, flare, fog and bright are discussing topics to Allium about their assailant and jem's pregnancy

Allium: how is the pregnancy coming

Jem: ok I hope this does not cause a miscarriage

Allium: let’s get inside, so we can try to ID the mastermind behind this.

Fog: what kind of motive might the attacker have.

Flare: normally squeegee works with another dragon called Leech. during the fight with squeegee he said that Leech hated killing children even unborn ones.

Allium: do you have any enemies that might want to do this

Jem: The only one I can think of is my sister.

flare: I can write a list, but the top one is Cedric Burnfeather. Sadly, I don't have any proof of this being true other than what you know.

Allium: odds are if this was a contract job they will try again but maybe with different people

Fog: how do you know that?

Bright: this is a common mafia tactic one is to never directly give your information and two is to achieve success on your mission regardless of sacrifice. I could be wrong, but it seems like they are not so much trying to kill you Jem but your child. I am going to try to contact Thunder to see if they can temporarily lift the banishment.

Allium: why not go to Eather?

Bright: if I was able to easily kidnap jem there I doubt it will be safer. Not to mention it is a very long distance without a fleet protecting us we would be sitting ducks.

Allium: SO, IT WAS YOU WHO KIDNAPPED HER.

Jem: My ship isn't that week.

flare: Bright is correct on that can your ship survive a fleet as likely the next level of escalation would be to send a fleet

Jem looked defeated as she knew that her ship can handle 1 or 2 ships with high firepower but not a fleet.

Jem: I can outrun them with my ship

flare: at the risk of safety and all it takes then would be one good shot as to obtain that high speed you will have to lower your shields. and I won't risk that. I know you want to get to your parents for protection but that isn't feasible.

Before the group could continue a loud explosion was heard on the floors above them.

bright: sounds like someone is attacking the building.

Another loud explosion was heard coming closer

Allium: we have to get to the mantle elevator.

Jem: isn't using elevators ill advised

Allium: under normal circumstances yes but that isn't a normal elevator

The group took to the stairs and every floor they went down there was an explosion on the floor above.

Allium: there it is (pointing at the elevator then using plant magic to press the call button)

The elevator was cylindrical with 1 button on the outside and 3 on the inside

The elevator opened and the whole elevator was filled with lava.

Bright: so, this is how things end trapped between two fires

then a voice rang out over the loudspeaker: This is Leech waterflame I have come to save you I know your husband has some beef with me and my boyfriend tried to kill you, but I don't wish your death...yet. come out to the ground floor landing strip

Jem: should we trust her?

flare: I don't see much choice in the matter as we don't have much time.

The moment the group left the room it exploded, and a rock barely missed Jem and hit fog in the back, and blood gushed out of the impact area

Jem: forgive me (using fire magic Jem cauterized the wound then she carried fog over her shoulder)

Jem: let’s go.

The group boarded the ship just barely before the landing strip exploded and fell 20 feet. (the ship's retrorockets activated keeping it stable)

Leech: well, well, well, what do we have here? A little flame came by asking for help. Your little distress beacon came in and I came to help

flare: I didn't activate a distress beacon

Jem: nor did I

bright: I didn't

Allium: I don't even know how to use one

fog: weekly I didn't

Leech: then who did?

flare: no clue. But I am thankful if you want to, I can pay you for transport to Earth. but first we got to get fog treated.

Leech: Flare aren't you still banished.

flare: with exception to emergencies and having multiple hitmen after me and my wife do count as a emergency

Allium: I just got clearance from the head council member that you are cleared to go to Earth for at least 2 months or a day after the mastermind has been caught.

Leech: isn't it illegal for monsters to have children on Earth.

Flare: odds are my father will rectify that as after we got married dad lied to mom that jem was 3/4 human and put the first stage of repealing the law.

Leech: were too specifically.

flare: I will give the coordinates later, but it used to be called Charleston

Jem: What about my ship

Allium: we will check the wreckage of the building and will pay for repairs

Name: Red Hot Fire part 5
Starting location: Leech's starship

Leech: were too specifically.

flare: I will give the coordinates later, but it used to be called charleston

Jem: What about my ship

Allium: we will check the wreckage of the building and will pay for repairs

After leech walks to the cockpit then puts the general coordinates for earth. and walks back

Leech: Jem, did you know at one point I dated your husband.

Jem: Really. that is interesting

leech: though I don't have any Idea as to why flare dumped me a long time ago. Do you know why?

Jem: I didn't even know you were even a part of his past until your boyfriend attacked. but from what flare told me is he dated a lot of monster girls but most treated him like a racist ready to attack. or constantly advertising their magic making him feel like s%$$# he can't directly use it.

leech: now that I think about it, I was over advertising my magic back then.

Jem: just curious about what form of magic you specialize in mine is Earth and fire magic and I inherited mind magic (quieter under her breath: even though I wish I didn't)

leech: Earth magic but also healing magic. Other than being a princess of Eather or queen of Luna do you have any side occupation?

Jem: yes, I design starships. as well as design power armor. my most recent form of research is finding how to tap into a human's magic storage.

leech: are you doing that for flare?

Jem: Not initially. Initially I was doing this for any being to use magic not just humans. Though having Flare around does help.

leech: what is your progress.

Jem: nearing completion flare has an early prototype just (looks down at her belly) this little one takes precedence

a blinding red light shown up at the cockpit

leech: looks like we have company! Jem, I am going to give you the cannon control

jem: is your ship exterior metal

leech: yes.

Jem: give the control to flare (taking off her wedding ring it then grows in size and pulls out a space suit with a set of magnetic boots and puts the ring back on her tail) I am going outside to use my magic

leech: Ok but I will give you this communicator so I can warn you If I do anything that can overpower your space suit.

flare: Jem isn't that dangerous.

Jem: Even being here is dangerous and I know you like using weapons

flare (seemingly conflicted): all right but be careful I don't want to lose you.

Jem put on the space suit and walked over to the air lock. activated the magnetic boots and walked out on top of the ship.

Jem took a good look at the fleet of ships at least 20 large ships (about the size of a city), 20 medium ships (about the size of a house) and 5 personal ships (only big enough to hold one passenger).

Jem: Flare, do you know any group that has a white crescent moon and a black house cat.

flare: s$#% sounds like the moonlight cats. We are going to have to hold out until we get to Earth's atmosphere. because there usually are double the number of large ships than you can see.

jem: How far are we from Earth.

leech: still about a thousand miles from the lunar orbit

Jem using magic, took two massive asteroids and used it to crush one of the ships. Soon after another took its place in formation

Jem: aww come on

flare: this is going to be a hard-won fight.

flare shot the cannon and disabled the engines of 6 large ships in which jem used magic to rain asteroids through the ships at extreme speed. some monsters with space suits exited the ships using fire magic to attempt to close the gap.

jem then pulled her hand cannon from the hidden holster on her ankle and shot half with one shot electrocuting them to death.

leech: I am going to do a flyby of luna flare is going to contact the fleet there.

one of the monsters then land on the ship behind Jem but before they can react flare shot them using the ships cannons only their feet survived before turning to dust

leech: jem you might want to get inside the ship we are entering the upper atmosphere of luna. and it might get extremely hot

Jem then walked to the air lock but before the door can close behind her a monster used their hand to stop the door from closing 

jem then summoned her family sword and sliced the hand off the door then slamed shut with a thud

soon after walking through the airlock Jem passed out
