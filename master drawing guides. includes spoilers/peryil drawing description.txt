extra personal racial details
has a belly button: the ambilical chord is attached to the egg internals before it is laid by this point it is mostly a leftover evolutionary trait from homo-magica

lays a unfertalized egg roughly once every 2 months around the 13th of the month since her 6th birthday. this is edible but she normally gives it to other monsters as she feels weird eating her own eggs.(she will if in a pinch) if they where fertilized the egg would take anywhere from human reproductive time frame all the way up to 5 years depending if sufficient heat was applied. she was a late due to insufficient heat (this is partially why her feather pattern is significantly thinner and was due to her mother being killed as she looked after the egg).

she has wings instead of arms this allows her to fly without using magic.

like most monsters internally they are more human than the animal that are externally seen. in fact if the solar council didn't make non-emergency cross race procedures illegal most human doctors probibly could opperate on a monster with little to no adjustment to the procedure. (that is before they became extinct due to brier's and cedric's genocidal policies)

peryil's outfit
typically wears a blue jumpsuit that can double as a one piece swimsuit
wears multiple leather tool strips made into like a vest
at her workshop she has gloves that give her the ability to grab and use machines/tools(they are generally stuck to the machines so she can't bring them with her. and the few that are not can only get power inside her home)

peryil's magic
Natural (external) Magic Level: 12.
Internal (Storage) Magic Level: 64.
Primary magic specialty(s): Fire
secondary magic specialty(s): mental(suppressed by her father it is slowly breaking down as TL:shadow flame progresses until chapter 5 in which it is completly unsuppressed. for female phoenixes this is very rare to have more than mental magic detection which her mother did have.[this means they can detect if mental magic is used but cannot use it unless it was used on them])

about aging/deaging
this is similar to a normal human but these details are to keep in mind
aging
very slowly lighten the feather color at age 1000 it is completely white
her eye color is based on estrogen levels in the body
in which as she gets older her eye color will slowly become very dark silver
deaging the character
to first 2 years
her eye color is a white with a slight silver tint
her breast size becomes similar to an infant
the tail is about 1/3 her size
she only has feathers similar where human hair would be
her eyes start white (iris coloration not pupil she is not blind just colorblind deuteranopic to be specific. the color blindness does not change) and slowly become colored. by age 3 it is fully colored to normal levels
to 10 and earlier
she follows similar development to a human but sped up at double speed
the breasts grows to B cup
Her apparent physical strength is similar to an average human female
Her actual strength is similar slightly stronger than a average human male
the tail ratio becomes close to what it is now

character specific breast sizes (band size in inches then cup size letter)
