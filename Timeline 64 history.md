this file was made for the main game Temporal Light but it is applicable to jem of twilight and light's adventure(the exact dates are different as development of jem of twilight)

the reason for the change in dates is due to the age difference between flare and jem(who was considered a minor and I did not want to give inappropriate connotations after light was born it is mostly the same)
