Temporal Light time travel types(back in time)
time travel via speed
if you travel faster than the speed of light time travel is possible
	you cannot affect the past you are invisible in every way
	the past however can still affect you(physically and emotionally)
	the effect wears off when you catch up to the time you left

time travel via magic
very few high powered magic spells have the ability to affect time
	if you travel back in time the universe will try to stop you the more you affect the timeline
	the past can still affect you
	if you travel to the future anything that happens can still change. you become seperate from the timeline changes.
	the effect wears off when you catch up to the time you left
	most of the magic is black magic that requires living sacrifices to use
	the only exception is owning a time crystal esscence however getting this is nearly impossible as the time crystals manage the timespace continum in that universe. and they don't just give it to anyone that wants one. 

Temporal light is the most powerful magic in the game series that if cast creates a beam of light that if it makes contact with anything living it erases them from the timeline and their past is generified(you become a generic person of the same race).
