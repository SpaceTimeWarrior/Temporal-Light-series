27-10-2022_19.4.35 is a debug room where enemies are spammed to test how the game acts under extreme lag. the game has a autoshutoff feature on the spawner when the fps drops below 15 fps. the highest I got was about 2000 enemy units with 20 party members. this image was my first big breakthrough of surpassing 1000 enemies. and about 100 before lag started to happen.
