Garnet and pearlite are in the throne room arguing

Garnet: Pearlite WHY DID YOU FORCE ME TO GIVE A BLESSING TO JEM. YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL ABOUT THE GUY

Pearlite: You were acting like your father. you told me to stop you remember

Garnet: NO, I WASN'T I... I WAS PROTECTING JEM FROM HIM!

pearlite: well your tone and inner thoughts was painting a completely different picture. AND DON'T YOU DARE GIVE ME THAT TONE!

Garnet: STOP WITH THAT SASS! YOU LET HER OFF EASY!

pearlite: NO I AM NOT BUT YOU HAVE TO LET HER MAKE HER OWN DECISIONS! NOT ONLY DID YOU THREATEN TO KILL FLARE YOU ALSO THREATENED TO KILL JEM!

Garnet: YOU ARE ON HIS SIDE ARN'T YOU (throws an ice bullet at pearlite which barely misses her tail)

Pearlite: NO, I AM ON JEM'S SIDE! HIS SIDE JUST ALLIGNS WITH JEM'S

Cay Neigh (female grey kitsune mid 40's) Jem's old Night Bodyguard came in hearing the commotion

Cay: maybe you two should calm... (she is cut off by an ice bullet and flaming thorn both barely missing her)

Pearlite and Garnet: STAY OUT OF THIS.

cay: ok I will go now (visibly startled and left the throne room)

pearlite: We should at least calm down.

garnet: pearlite ... I I am sorry I should of let her make her own decisions...I have been a horrible father haven't I. I am just like my father arenâ€™t I... just a serial killer with a crown

pearlite: but you didn't kill anyone did you? At most probably caused a bodyguard to s$%^ themselves.

garnet: no I have not yet killed anyone. we did at least startle cay. didn't we...should we go after her

pearlite: Naw most likely she realized we needed space. and staying around probably would of gotten her killed. I vowed to keep you from becoming your father, don't you remember.

Garnet: I do. I still hate he killed your parents. and I hate that guy Jem was with.

pearlite: you mean flare, If they where serious with marriage you might want to memorize it. I disagree with Jem going with that guy, but she has to make her own mistakes and learn especially if she is to take the throne. and for all we know we might be the ones who are making the mistake.

garnet:... ... ...I am sorry I tried to harm you.

pearlite: it will take more than a ice bullet to do serious damage why not we go off to bed it is getting late.
