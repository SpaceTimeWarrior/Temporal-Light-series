November 25th,6465-potential prophecy coming true.mp3
	A human child was born into the royal family with magic affinity... this matches the prophecy almost exactly... that is just a coincidence...I can't ignore this. Ember keeps telling me is prophecies are for idiots. I am not an idiot but...

September 21st,6477-gotta take matters into my own hands.mp3
	A child matching the prophecy was born in the wolfsbane family yesterday. multiple coincidences have been occurring I have to stop the prophecy. I know the child's mother is visiting Earth tomorrow. maybe I can rig a accident to occur.
September 22nd,6477-killed the fox.mp3
	I killed the fox's mother now to pin the blame on the human.
september 22nd,6477-crap wrong fox.mp3
	I killed the mother's sister bonemeal.no matter I still hidden all evidence of my doing. and returned to the scene of the crime early but not too early to prevent suspicion. Thankfully this hid any suspicion of feathers being on the ground.
september 23rd,6477 I Did it.mp3
	I finally managed to pin the blame on that human. I got him banished from earth. Since I know the lightbringers don't have family elsewhere he will die.

notes from officer talon
So, he killed bonemeal... now I feel sorry for flare...I helped him get away with it. I know that I didn't know at the time which would absolve guilt legally, but I wish I never came across this. well time to submit this to evidence. I will let my partner take the call from Luna.
