images 1-3 where cut and replaced with a scene card in the start of the game. after this it leads into the game's intro.
the location was removed and replaced with a dialog that states "this room is unavailable in the gb/gbc version"
this was cut for length as well as dificulty to make. if I finish the game and there is extra space I might add it back in.
this also has dialog of a character that was cut cay neigh. a grey kitsune that is jem's night bodyguard. she also aided ember and pearlite in raising jem.
