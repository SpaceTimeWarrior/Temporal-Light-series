Light Lightbringer(adult but cursed)
ABCXYZ-same as jem-physical attacks are not quite as strong but fairly strong,but magical attacks are twice as strong
start same as jem but healing is to full and Temporal Light has no health sacrifice

same as adult but magic strength is doubled.
However as the magic bar increases the odds of taking overmagic damage also increases
lore: overmagic-for most mortals this is rare but if a mortal's magic external power level goes over 1000 their bodies start to catch on fire and melt(overriding immunities).
