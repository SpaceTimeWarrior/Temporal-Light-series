# Temporal-Light-series
this is the main page of temporal light and offers a history of the whole series.

lets start with the begining of development of the series. 

this series started with a private fanfiction in 2012. the fanfiction was to crossover pokemon mystery dungeon and the tv series. this was the first version of chris, jewel, jem ,and light(planned but never got to it) where changed severely from this story. the reason why this was never made public was due to many reasons the biggest is the reputation of the IP holder the fanfiction was based on.

the next part of the series was the minecraft mod version 1.7.10 this was the first version of the magic system, as well as many important weapons originated from this. a updated version was made later before the first public game demos where released. this updated version was an attempt to add lore to the original version. saddly this version never got much done as I ran into technical limitations specifically in structure generation. but I did plan to have each monster type as 2 mobs one male and one female sadly only 2 in total where made. I also wanted multiple of these have npc/villager trades interactions but have a neutral hostility with the ability to attack the player. I also had plans for each having it's own village type. sadly I could not get random multipart structures working. the only structure that did make it in was a lore one. I planned on making 4 dimensions at least but only made 2.

the next part is the main version of temporal light. this is temporarily paused due to active development of the side game Temporal Light: Jem of Twilight. this game takes place accross the multiverse years after jem of twilight and 1 month after Light's adventure. this game uses the universe 64(the one jem of twilight/light's adventure takes place in) as a hub world of sorts and uses the temporal knife to travel to these universes.this game had multiple engines that where used. the first attempt was in late 2015 to mid 2017. this was using the RPG Maker engine. the biggest reason for changing engines ended with having major beef with the combat for the game. I wanted a real time combat game not a turn based one. and to do this conversion was to completely rewriting the combat system and I thought that if I am going to do that I might as well make it in another engine. the second attempt was in gamemaker studio. this was due to a game I liked that was released in 2015(though I did not know of its existance until 2017) used a version of this engine. this is the last version that uses the original story that had all the characters in the same universe. the last engine used was gamemaker studio 2. this version's story had a complete rework. and created the multiverse. this version is also the first time the series name was used (prior to this was TimeSpaceRPG/TimeSpacemod). I am currently looking at other engines. this is due to internal issues with the engine as well as a few others like. 1. not having a easy way to do 3d rendering. 2. no allowing 3rd party kinematic animation software.

now on to spin off games.
first I am going to talk about is Temporal Light:Light's adventure. this was made on a whim for the FreeRPG day on June 24th 2023. the development of this game staretd around mid may 2023 here is the FreeRPG day version and password. https://timespacewarrior.itch.io/temporal-light-lights-adventure-free-rpg-day-demo-web-version password:"FreeRPGDay2023". I decided the game had some interesting features so I continued to update this. I found out about the GB Compo 2023 game jam near the end of june. I originally planned on using this game initially for this game jam but many factors steared me away from using this. 1. this game reuses a lot of maps made before the jam began. 2. while the game did follow the theme I felt the story did not allow the player to act accordingly to the theme. 
here is the link to the newest version: https://timespacewarrior.itch.io/temporal-light-lights-adventure-demo  I do plan on coming back to this game but after jem of twilight's completion. and here is the github: https://github.com/SpaceTimeWarrior/temporal-light-lights-adventure

the next spin off game released was Temporal Light: Jem of Twilight. this game was made for the gamejam talked about in the previous game. the story was based on a single paragraph from my game notes. several characters make their first appearance in this game mostly every character with the exception of flare and light. some characters did have data but never fully implemented in the prior games such as jem,cedric,ember. sadly I did not place in the top 15 likely due to the gamejam version had a multitude of glitches and reused the engine in Light's adventure. very few maps are reused from light's adventure and one of the two had changes made. while some reused maps where in the code but never accessed them this is due to a planned feature that as the game progressed you would change luna to match the choices you make either directly or indirectly(by game events). here are all the versions publically available https://github.com/SpaceTimeWarrior/temporal-light-Jem-of-Twilight,  https://gamejolt.com/games/Temporal-Light-Jem-of-Twilight/847940,    https://timespacewarrior.itch.io/temporal-light-jem-of-twilight    here is the game's wiki: https://github.com/SpaceTimeWarrior/temporal-light-Jem-of-Twilight/wiki

the last game to be developed was a spin off game of jem of twilight called Jem's magic lesson. this game starts half a year before chapter 1 and about a month after chapter 2. this is a arcade game that was released on gamejolt. I may update the game to improve the dialog boxes to be within the game window(rather than create a new one) however my main focus right now is Jem of Twilight. here is the link to download the game https://gamejolt.com/games/Temporal-Light-jems-magic-lesson/852033
