this was an attempt to try to create emersion.
I didn't want to take the easy route and just make all monsters use earbuds.
the reason why not use standard human headphones is most of the monsters have different ears.(and in different locations)
what braught this to my attention was a devlog for the game project feline.
the other reason why I didn't do a custom fitting set like what inspired this is due to the fact most of the characters are not rich to have a custom fitting set.
thus I conveniently had a pair of RIG head phones which the ear pieces where detachable this is the main idea I used.
I added a round shaft in which would allow it to rotate around the head to the ear.
I also made the earpiece detachable for maintnance and to allow more ear types rabbit ears for example. this also makes it so humans can use the headphones.
the next problem was to hold the headset in place.
the first Idea was having 1 detachable strap to hold it on this was abandoned early as that would break quickly with repeated use
the next idea in which I widen the strap/multiple straps. again same reason why the above idea was scrapped.
lastly I looked at the fabric cuff and thaught what if that be the equivilant of a strap by putting an elastic band.
I thaught of using magic but that would not work with some.
this mini project started around mid febuary of 2023 and the last update was march 4th of 2023
